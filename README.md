👋 Hi, I’m Amanda Feijóo

I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer who genuinely enjoys building things that are useful, beautiful, and easy to use. I work across the whole stack — from backend logic to frontend design — but I’m especially drawn to the visual side, where I can bring ideas to life through clean, responsive interfaces.

🌍 I’m originally from Honduras, spent 14 years in Barcelona, and now live in Trondheim, Norway. That mix of cultures has definitely shaped how I work, collaborate, and connect with people.

🎓 I hold a Master’s Degree in Web Development and Applications from Universidad Europea de Madrid with an overall GPA of 9.04/10.

My thesis project, DineBooker (graded 10/10), is a restaurant booking platform built with React, Django, and PostgreSQL — you can check out the demo in my portfolio.
I also developed FitLife Gym as a pre-thesis academic project (graded 8.6/10), focused on fitness class management and user engagement.

💼 I've also worked on real freelance projects, including:

- Arrazola Psicología – a booking and payment system for a licensed therapist (React + Django + Stripe)
- Webcode-Art – my personal portfolio and contact platform
- Starting soon: a new freelance platform for nannies in Switzerland


📱 I also build mobile apps using React Native, and test them with both Android Studio and the iOS Simulator.

💻 Tech I’ve been using:

Frontend: React, Angular, React Native, MUI, styled-components
Backend: Django, Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
Tools & Platforms: Git, Docker, Stripe, Cloudinary, Railway, Render, Netlify, Google Cloud, Canva
I care a lot about writing clean, maintainable code and creating user experiences that feel natural. I’m always curious, always learning — and always excited about the next thing to build.
